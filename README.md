Music industry: past and future directions of the U.S. market 

We imagined to be the financial consultants of a big record label. The CEOs have decided to invest part of their revenue into partner companies who produce music formats, in order to lower future production costs. 

The music industry, like many others, has changed completely in the last four decades due to technological advancements. 
Record labels need to keep up with ever-changing music formats and corresponding shifts in consumer preferences. 
That’s where we come in! 
Using three different datasets and four different classes of statistical models, we will give our clients and overview of future industry directions, market leaders and even consumers’ song choices. 

You can either save datasets and scripts in the same folder on your pc and run them in RStudio, or easily read our results in the Powerpoint.
